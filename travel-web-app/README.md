# Travlr Getaways - Full-Stack Travel Platform

Welcome to the main repository for the **Travlr Getaways** web application. This project demonstrates the evolution of a full-stack travel platform, tracking its migration from a traditional Express.js and MongoDB backend to a modernized, containerized architecture using the LoopBack API framework and AWS DynamoDB.

## Repository Structure

This repository is split into two distinct versions to highlight the architectural progression of the application:

* **[Version 1 (v1)](./travlr-app-v1/README.md):** The original implementation. Built using Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars (HBS), and a MongoDB NoSQL database. 
* **[Version 2 (v2)](./travlr-app-v2/README.md):** The modernized, cloud-ready implementation. This version refactors the backend using the LoopBack API framework, migrates the data layer to AWS DynamoDB, and orchestrates the development environment using Docker.

*Please navigate to the respective `v1` or `v2` directories and read their individual `README.md` files for detailed documentation on architecture, functionality, and testing.*

## User Interface

*The front-end design and user experience remain consistent across both versions of the application.*
